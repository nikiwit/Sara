--- PAGE: Campus Access ---
URL: https://apiit.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ITSM/pages/218759229/Campus+Access

This discusses the access to different facilities and offices by both staff and students on campus through the use of an APCard
which may be a Student ID-Card or Staff ID-Card.
What is Building Access?
APU has implemented an APCard access system on campus to limit public access particularly after office hours. APU community (students and staff) gain access to the building (where permitted) and may unlock doors by swiping/tapping their APCard on the building card reader.
Staff and students have different levels of access to facilities and offices on campus. Using an APCard, can be a student ID card (otherwise called a TP-card on campus) or a Staff member ID-Card; access to a facility like a gym (Sweat Zone) or staff offices is granted as needed. Swipe the APCard on the readers placed by the door.
Access to the building from Level 1 and Level 2 is locked between 12 a.m. and 6 a.m. every day. Schedules may vary depending on special needs, such as students’ events.
How can I ensure my APCard works for building access?
Upon receiving your APCard, the card number has been keyed into the database system that controls all appropriate electronic doors on campus.
If your APCard does not work, and you need access to a building, please walk-in with the APCard to the
TechCentre Office, which is presently at level 6, opposite Block D, during office hours
. The technical staff will have the card verified and the access-issue remedied if necessary.
Can I access the SweatZone using my APCard?
Yes, you can access SweatZone using your APCard.
Can I access the On-Campus residence and section of academic staff using my APCard?
On-campus residences can only be accessed by residents, not visitors.
Sections of academic staff can only be accessed by authorized staff and authorized students.

In AttendiX 2.0 you can search for attendance record in
Attendance History
with class code. You may have to search for an attendance record to edit/update the record or delete a class attendance record. This is a guide to help you better search for attendance records and get quick results. In the attendance history, class code is shown as the following example below:
Lecture:
AICT004-4-2-OS-L1-UCDF1904ICT-DI-ITR-SE-ABB
Tutorial:
AICT004-4-2-OS-T-UCDF1904ICT-DI-ITR-ABB
Tutorial Group 1:
AICT004-4-2-OS-T1-UCDF1904ICTSE-ABB
For this guide, we will use the
module
Operating System (OS) AICT004-4-2-OS and
intake
UCDF1904ICT, as an example to show ways to search for class code. The end of module code (AICT004-4-2-
OS
) is a short class code (
OS
).
Module Name
Operating System
Class Code
AICT004-4-2-OS
Short Class Code
OS
Intake
UCDF1904ICT
For searching, we will use
% (percentage)
character to specify keywords from class code to get better search results.
For example, let’s take class code
AICT004-4-2-OS-T-UCDF1904ICT-DI-ITR-ABB
and see how we can search this class code in attendance history using
%
character in the table below:
AICT004%
Finds any class code that starts with “
AICT004”
%SE%
Finds any class code that has “SE” in any position
As you type class code keywords in the search field, you get a search result in real-time. The following is a quick reference guide to search for class code using keywords:
Search for intake code
%UCDF1904ICT%
Search for intake and specific  course program
e.g. Software Engineering (SE)
%UCDF1904ICT%SE%
Search for the module using a shortcode
e.g. Operating System AICT004-4-2-OS
%OS%
Search for module and intake
%OS%UCDF1904CT%
Search for the module, class type, and intake:

URL: https://apiit.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ITSM/pages/221055638/Dealing+with+slow+reduced+Bandwidth+when+using+Microsoft+Teams

One of the challenges educators and students might face when using Microsoft Teams from your respective locations especially when out of campus would be dealing with slow/reduced bandwidth.
Below are the suggested workarounds:
The solution to the challenge above would be to “
Turn off
” the video when not required. You are advised to use
audio with screen sharing
if bandwidth is an issue.
You are advised not to play any video during the screen sharing with audio mode. The screen sharing is ideally used to beam the presentation slides along with living demos (if any). If there are any videos to be played, do share the video link with students and get them to view from their side. You may post the video link in the respective channel within your Class Teams.
Disable video
Share Screen
Select the application you want to display so to hid the rest of your info.
Close or hide any sensitive information before sharing your screen.

--- PAGE: How do I restrict access to items or activities to certain groups or students of the course? ---

There are some modules that has two intakes starting in the same month ex.(062026) which will be in one course in Moodle. Therefore, you can differentiate between them by choosing the targeted groups from the filter in participants page as below:
L-4 and L-5 are from different intakes with different start dates
There are many cases in which it is useful to restrict access to material or activities in Moodle, including restricting sections so that students belonging could only access sections and the associated materials that they are in.
Step 1 -
Click on the the “Edit Mode” slider
Step 2a -
Create and edit a section that you want restricted to a particular group
Tip: You may duplicate sections to save yourself time instead of doing it from scratch. If you have any activities within the section, they will be duplicated as well. Rename your sections so you know which intake should have access to them.
Step 2b -
Go to the section’s “Edit Settings” (refer to above image) and set the restrictions under the “Restrict Access” settings
Step 3 -
Under
Restrict Access
, click
Add restriction
and Select “Group” and pick the group you want to have access to the item i.e TM___AICT010-4-2-BSMA-L-4___2025-07-07.
You can also click on the eye icon to hide the section from students who do not belong to the restricted group.
Step 4 -
Save changes
Restricting Topics
It is possible to add a group restriction on a topic or week.  Follow the same procedure as above, but set the restriction on the entire topic.  You will need to leave the topic and all its contents visible, but Moodle will display a label indicating that access to the topic is restricted.  You do not need to adjust the permissions/restrictions for any of the items within the topic.  If the topic itself is restricted so will all the contents of the topic.
Different Intakes
One module folder may contain two or more intakes, which can then be found confusing when adding content and activities. Please note the enrollment process is automated by the system. In order to not confuse the materials and activities intended for different groups a solution is to
utilise restrictions
so that the students from different intakes will be able to see materials meant for them while being in the same folder.
Important Tip
-  If you restrict access to an entire section, all activities in that section will follow the restrictions set. That way, you do not have to set restrictions one by one for each activity.

--- PAGE: How to Create a Course in Moodle? ---
URL: https://apiit.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ITSM/pages/221055835/How+to+Create+a+Course+in+Moodle

A guide in Moodle is a complete training session with theory and practice. The theory helps to convey knowledge with the help of lessons containing text, images, and videos; hands-on activities such as quizzes (check out our
How to Create a Moodle Quiz: Step-by-Step Guide
) allow you to check how much the student has learned.
Creating a Lesson in Moodle
As an example, we’ll build a course on Workplace Safety rules and a lesson on Fire Safety. To continue, you’ll need to open a class-specific folder and get
the source file with text (https://ispri.ng/JWR82)
so you can just copy and paste it in the sample lesson.
Step 1 -
Open your Course in Moodle
From the course overview, open your class-specific folder.
How to Add a Topic to the Course?
Step 2 -
When you open a class-specific folder on Moodle, on the top right corner of the page click on
setting gear icon
. A drop-down menu list will open and from this list select
“Turn
editing on”.
Step 3 -
Scroll down and you will see an option to
Add an activity or resource
and
Add topics
.
Click on
Add topics
it and a window will popup to enter a number of topics you want to add. For this example, we will add only 1 (one) topic and click
Add topics
.
Step 4 -
A new topic will be created
Topic 1
, rename this to
Fire Safety
and then, in this section of topic click
Add an activity or resources
. From
Add an activity or resources
popup window, under the list of
Activities
look for
Lesson
, select this activity and click
Add
.
You will be redirected to a page for the configuration of this
Lesson
. We’ll need to set up four sections:
General:
Enter the name of the lesson and its description.
Appearance:
Configure the lesson design. Would you like learners to see a progress bar or demonstrate the lesson as a slideshow?
Flow Control:
Set up the rules for taking the lesson. For example, it’d be wise to allow learners to view the lesson on fire safety several times, but for an exam session, it’s better to give just one attempt.
Grade:
Determine the rules of assessment. Will you use points or a scale to evaluate the results? What is the passing grade? For the sample lesson, set four points as the passing grade as there are four test tasks.
Step 5 -
Click
Save and display
.
How to Create a Question Page?
Step 6 -
Our sample lesson starts with the question,
What do you do if you smell smoke?
To add it, click
Add a question page
in the
Edit
tab.
Step 7 -
From the list of s
elect a question type
; select
Multichoice
for the sample and then, click
Add a question page
.
Next, you will be redirected to the question page setup. Starting with question page title and content.
Page title
What to do if a fire starts
Page contents
Imagine it’s an ordinary day at the office. Suddenly, you smell smoke.
What do you do?
Step 8 -
Now you have to provide an answer and responses for multiple choice. Define the award for the correct answer. You may just leave
1 point
by default.
Answer 1
I’ll look around to find the nearest stairway, leave all my belongings, and run to the exit.
Response
Right.
You didn’t panic and got out. Yet you managed to breathe in smoke, as you didn’t protect your nose and mouth while evacuating.
Make sure there are
no points given
, as this answer is wrong.
Answer 2
I’ll pack up and go to the nearest exit.
Response
Wrong.
When there’s smoke in the building, you must leave immediately. By wasting time on packing things, you may lose your chance to get out, as smoke and fire spread very quickly.
Step 9 -
Click
Save page
.
Your question page will be successfully added to the course.
How to Create a Content Page?
Step 10 -
The content page is a building block for creating a lesson in Moodle. It may contain text, pictures, audio or video. You can click
Add a content page
in the beginning.
Step 11 -
But in our case of this sample course, we first created question page after, we can create more pages by clicking on
Add new page
and from drop-down list select
Add a content page
.
Below, you will also see a
Content 1
(
Content 2, Content 3
, and so on) section. Using these fields, you can set up
navigation
within a lesson. Each Content is a button that forwards a learner to another page of the lesson. For instance, you can create buttons for every page of the lesson using the
Jump
option, so learners will be able to
jump
to a different page –
next page, previous page, first page, last page, or any other page on the course
. If you prefer closed navigation and don’t fill in the Content fields, then learners will have to study the pages one by one.
For the sample course, we don’t need any extra navigation buttons except Next and Previous.
Step 12 -
Create the Next button by entering the word,
Next
in the
Content 1
description and choose to jump to the
Next page
on each new page you add, and
Previous
in the
Content 2
description and choose to jump to
Previous page
on each new page you add.
How to Add More Content and Question Pages?
Step 13 -
Create the rest of the pages using the lesson source file. By clicking on
Add new page
and from drop-down list select the type of page you want to add –
content page, question page. etc.
In the end, you should get the following structure:
The lesson is ready. You can preview it through the admin panel. The preview of the Fire Safety sample lesson is shown below.

You can facilitate multiple markers by either using
Group mode
under
Common module settings
for Turnitin and Moodle assignments or
Marking workflow
for Moodle assignments.
We recommend using the
Groups
method, as the
Marking workflow
method is more complex to setup and requires additional steps to release the final grades and feedback to students.
Groups
Students must first be added to groups.
Step 1 -
Open the assignment you want to edit, click on the
icon and click on
edit settings
Step 2 -
Set Group mode (under
Common module settings
) to Separate groups. You may also first try directly proceeding to step 5 as this setting should be the default already

--- PAGE: An Overview of Assignments in Moodle ---
URL: https://apiit.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ITSM/pages/221055928/An+Overview+of+Assignments+in+Moodle

Assignments in Moodle allow you to collect and evaluate student work. Managing student work using an Assignment
activity gives you the following benefits:
Paperless management of student work
The
Assignment activity
provides a convenient database of student submissions that you can organize and manage online.
Grading and feedback through Moodle
The
Assignment activity
includes a grading interface through which you can enter grades and provide feedback to each student.
Due dates automatically appear in the Calendar
If you specify a due date for an assignment, that date will appear in the
Calendar
block and in the
Upcoming Events
block. Students can see at a glance when their work will be due.
Assignment activity can manage the following kinds of submissions:
Online text
Students enter content directly into a text box on the assignment submission page. Useful for short papers or brief paragraphs.
File submissions
Students upload files on the submission page. Useful for longer papers or other file-based work.
Both Online text and files
Students can upload files and type text online. For example, a student can upload a file containing an essay and use the online text box to write a brief cover note to the instructor.
Offline work: -
No Online Submission
You can also create an assignment activity with no online submission options for students. This is useful for evaluating work such as papers you are collecting in print, classroom presentations, performances, or lab experiments. The activity can be graded in Moodle and the due date will appear in the
Calendar
block.

--- PAGE: Turnitin error: M14: 11 Your Session Has Expired. This paper is not available. ---
URL: https://apiit.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ITSM/pages/221055938/Turnitin+error+M14+11+Your+Session+Has+Expired.+This+paper+is+not+available.

Error
When trying to open submission in moodle, students and staff may occasionally come across the so-called M14 error.
Reasons
Turnitin’s own technical support team has suggested that this error indicates one of the following has occurred:
A paper can fail to process correctly if it contains complex content such as
dense vector images
that take too long to process. To work around this issue the student is advised to replace any vector images (Examples of Vector graphics are: AI, EPS, WMF, and PICT (Mac)) in their paper with raster images (jpg/jpeg, psd, png, tiff, bmp and gif).
Some
PowerPoint templates
may include vector images.
Use of a
third-party pdf converter
/converter other than the in-built MS Office O365 one.
Also, Turnitin has suggested that if the
first page of a paper includes an image without text,
the processing process is sometimes aborted which makes the paper inaccessible.
Includes text with
visual effects such as 3D glow or shadow.
The file is
password protected.

Download the originally submitted file off Moodle and check whether any of the obvious above mentioned reasons apply after all: pictures on the front page saved as .odt, pictures only and missing text, etc.
If the submission looks perfectly fine to you, do the following: Log in to your Native Turnitin Account or request from the Library assistant then locate the relevant submission. If the inbox is anonymized you may have to cross-check submission titles and date/time stamp to identify the correct submission. Alternatively, you may need to de-anonymize the name of that particular student only.
If you hover over the black exclamation mark if available, you should see the below message.
Click on the exclamation mark and wait a few minutes for Turnitin to refresh the submission. Refresh the page and return to moodle and try to open the paper.
note
There may be
several submissions with a black exclamation mark, not all of them are M14 errors.
Other reasons for black exclamation marks are, for instance,
word usage patterns that sometimes interfere with normal match detection =
Turnitin being unable to recognize all the text in a submission. While this could be an indication of an intentional attempt to avoid similarity checking, it also occurs when converting files to PDF.
M14 errors on the TurnitinUK website can be identified by either a missing pencil icon or two dashes instead of a similarity percentage.

Turnitin Accepted File Types:
Turnitin currently accepts the following file types up to 40MB for upload into an assignment:
Microsoft Word™ (DOC and DOCX)
Corel WordPerfect®
HTML
Adobe PostScript®
Plain text (TXT)
Rich Text Format (RTF)
Portable Document Format (PDF)
Microsoft PowerPoint (PPT, PPTX, and PPS) (May not generate an Originality Report) Turnitin converts the PowerPoint slide deck into a static PDF, leaving all text and images in their original format but leaving out features such as presenter notes, embedded video, and animations. Text with visual effects is not supported, and it is recommended that any visual effects such as shadows and 3-D be removed prior to submitting to Turnitin.
Hangul (HWP)
Microsoft Excel® (.xls and .xlsx). The version of the file that can be viewed in GradeMark will look the same as it would if the Excel file had been saved as a PDF and submitted to Turnitin. We highly recommend that students pay attention to the image preview provided in the single file submission to verify that the file is presented in an acceptable manner.  Users can adjust the way the file looks by editing the page setup and print area settings for the file prior to saving it and submitting it to Turnitin.
For assignments that accept any file types the following image file types can be displayed and rendered in GradeMark, but will not generate an Originality Report:
JPEG
GIF
PNG
TIFF
BMP
PICT
Non-supported file types
Microsoft® Works (.wps) file types.
Apple Pages file types.
Spreadsheets created outside of Microsoft Excel (i.e. .ods).
GDOC files (.gdoc) which are just links to online Google Document files, but don’t actually contain text or the document’s content. Google Drive must be used to upload Google Docs.
Microsoft Word 2007 macros-enabled (.docm) files
Zip files
All other file types that are not one of the file formats listed above will be accepted by Turnitin when the setting for
Allow submission of any file type
is set to
Yes
, but the file may not be displayed in GradeMark. When files cannot be displayed in GradeMark, Lecturers and Tutors are still able to download the original files.
File names
Punctuation in file names can generate errors when submitted to Turnitin. When students name their Turnitin assignment files, they should avoid using any punctuation except underscore ‘_’.
Turnitin and Nova Fonts
Students using Windows 10 and/or Microsoft Office 2016 may experience issues submitting work to Turnitin if using one of the new fonts such as
Arial Nova
. A workaround to this would be to ask students to change the font to a type commonly used in previous versions of Word (such as Arial) before submission to Turnitin.

--- PAGE: Why does the similarity report say Pending after I resubmit? ---
URL: https://apiit.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ITSM/pages/221086341/Why+does+the+similarity+report+say+Pending+after+I+resubmit

There are many reasons why you may want to resubmit to Turnitin. Perhaps you discover a mistake, or you were only checking your similarity report ahead of the deadline. This guide helps you to understand what you can and cannot do with resubmissions.
Turnitin allows you to
resubmit 3 times
, and then you must
wait 24 hours
.
If you make a resubmission, you will see this message:
You have already submitted a paper to this assignment and a Similarity Report was generated for your submission. If you choose to resubmit your paper, your earlier submission will be replaced and a new report will be generated. After three resubmissions, you will need to wait 24 hours after a resubmission to see a new Similarity Report.
This policy is set by Turnitin. Moodle Support is not able to override this or make reports generate faster.
note
Instructors are advised not to submit request to delete submissions to make multiple re-submissions with an assumption that this action will generate the Similarity Report quicker. Turnitin Support will not entertain deletion requests of this nature.
Instructors are advised not to submit request to delete submissions to make multiple re-submissions with an assumption that this action will generate the Similarity Report quicker. Turnitin Support will not entertain deletion requests of this nature.
This does not mean that your submission will be considered late, even if the report is still pending after the due date. The time and date shown in the submitted column is considered your official submission time. Your tutors will understand that sometimes the report will take longer.
Please only contact us if the report has taken longer than 24 hours to appear.  Open a ticket with ITHelpdesk  via
Virtual Help Centre (https://apiit.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portals)
or go to APSpace > More >
Help Centre (https://apiit.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portals)
, and mention the name of the Course Code where you submitted it and link of Moodle Course Folder, and the Paper ID.

OneDrive
, developed by Microsoft, is an online cloud storage service designed to facilitate seamless file management and collaboration. This platform enables users to engage in concurrent document editing, web-based document modification, as well as folder creation and sharing.
For individuals utilizing Microsoft's suite of productivity tools, such as students and staff, OneDrive is an integral component of the
Microsoft 365@APU (https://apiit.atlassian.net/wiki/wiki/spaces/ITSM/pages/218890448)
Subscription package. This subscription encompasses not only access to the Microsoft Office suite but also grants users a substantial storage capacity of 5TB within the OneDrive cloud storage service.
One of the hallmark features of OneDrive is its capacity to maintain synchronization between locally stored files on a user's computer and the files stored within the cloud. This synchronization extends across multiple devices, including laptops, smartphones, and tablets. As a result, users are afforded the convenience of accessing their files from virtually any location.

How to Share Files in OneDrive, follow the steps below:
Step 1:
Go to the OneDrive website and then sign in with your Microsoft account. If you don’t have an account yet, you need to create one.
Step 2:
On accessing your OneDrive, you need to choose the files or folders that you want to share. In this case, the file I want to share is “Attachments”. Right-click on the folder and select share.
Step 3:
On clicking the share button, you will be redirected to a box where you can choose who can access the file that you want to share. Copy LinkThe copy link is used to share items with a lot of people you might not even know personally. You can use these links to post to Facebook, Twitter, or any other social media.
After copying the link, there will be a message stating that the link has been copied.
⦁ Allow editing
When you share files or folders with the allow editing options, people can edit the files, add or delete it in a shared folder. The link can also be forwarded and modified to change the list of the people sharing this folder. Unchecking this box means that people can only view the file or folder that you are sharing.
⦁ Set expiration date
If you insert an expiration date, the link will only work until the date you have set. Then after the expiration date, the link will be invalid.
⦁ Set password
This will prompt the user to enter a password before they can get access to the file. You will need to provide the password separately to the users.
Step 4-
Link settings
⦁ Anyone with the link
In this scenario, anyone with the link can get access to the shared folder and can edit or add the shared item.
⦁ People in Asia Pacific University with the link
In this scenario, only the people within Asia Pacific University can access the shared folder. This link only works within the organization.
⦁ People with existing access
In this scenario, the shared folder will be sent to the people who you have already saved and granted access to before.
⦁ Specific people
In this scenario, only people you choose will get access to the shared file.

Availability settings
We recommend that assignment deadlines are set between 9-5 Monday-Friday to ensure educational technology, technology, and course office support is available for students who experience problems submitting assignments.
All assignment submission areas with deadlines should be clearly visible to students from the start date of the module. Assessment criteria should also be available to students from Moodle.
If you do not need to provide your students with extra time to submit, we recommend you set the

Maximum number of uploaded files
Set the
Maximum number of uploaded files
as required by the assignment. Please note, this is also the maximum number of feedback files that you can attach to each individual student when providing feedback. For example, if you want a student to submit one file but want to upload two feedback files then select three files. Remember to advise the student on how many files they should submit in the assignment instructions.
Maximum submission size
This setting defaults to the maximum upload limit for Moodle of
200MB
.
Accepted file types
Accepted file types can be restricted by entering a semicolon-separated list of types, for example ‘video/mp4; audio/mp3; image/png; image/jpeg’. You may also limit to extensions by including the dot, for example ‘.png; .jpg’ If the field is left empty, then all file types are allowed.

Require students click submit button
We strongly recommend that you do not change this setting from the default of
No
as this can cause problems for students submitting. If set to
Yes
, students will have to click a
Submit
button to declare their submission as final. If they forget to click the
Submit
button before the deadline then their submission will show as late. A second issue is that if students click the
Submit
button before the deadline, but then update their work and wish to upload this newly edited file they will be unable to do so as they have already declared their submission to be the final one. They would then need to contact their lecturer and ask them to manually send their submission back to them.
Submission settings
Require that students accept the submission statement
This is set to Yes by default. We ask that you do not change this so that students confirm that they understand what is required of them when submitting assignments to City.
Attempts reopened
If you require students to resubmit an assignment following a fail at the first attempt you will find the improvements in assignment resubmission useful. This setting allows you to specify how assignment attempts are reopened. The options available are:
Never
(assignment does not allow multiple attempts),
Manually
(Lecturer reopens the assignment for the student), or
Automatically until pass
(Assignment automatically reopens until the student reaches passing grade that has been set by the Lecturer in the Gradebook).
Maximum attempts
This setting allows you to specify how many attempts students should have at resubmitting an assignment once it has been reopened. To enable a resubmission, this needs to be set to at least 2.

Turnitin plagiarism plugin settings
You can generate Originality Reports for PDF and Word assignments submitted using Moodle’s assignment activity.
We recommend using Moodle assignment feedback functionality and not GradeMark when marking your Moodle assignment with Turnitin plugin enabled. Do not use Feedback Studio to provide grades and feedback for student assignments as there are issues with synching grades between Moodle assignment screen and Feedback. Students have also reported difficulty in opening Feedback Studio feedback in Moodle assignments. Use Moodle’s feedback functionality for adding feedback.
Before you enable Turnitin in your Moodle assignment have a look at the
Accepted file types

Report Generation Speed
The default setting is to
Generate reports immediately (resubmissions are allowed until due date)
. Originality Reports for the initial submission by each student to this assignment will be generated immediately. Students may resubmit as often as they wish until the assignment due date. Originality Reports for the second or subsequent submission will require a 24-hour delay before the Originality Report begins processing. Only the latest submission is available to the Lecturer or student. Previous versions are removed. Student submissions will compare against one another within the assignment on the due date and time which may result in a change in the Originality Report, Similarity Index and results at the due date and time. Other options available are:

Grading method
The
Simple Direct Grading method
is the most commonly used grading option.
The
Marking Record
is an advanced grading method where a lecturer can enter a comment per criterion and a mark up to a maximum.
The
Grading Method
is an advanced grading form used for criteria-based assessment. The rubric consists of a set of criteria. For each criterion, several descriptive levels are provided. A numerical grade is assigned to each of these levels. The rater chooses which level answers/describes the given criterion best. The raw rubric score is calculated as a sum of all criteria grades. The final grade is calculated by comparing the actual score with the worst/best possible score that could be received.
Grade category
This determines where your assignment will sit within the grades area. You will need to set up the categories in the
Grader report
first. Please see the link to the grades guidance at the bottom of the page for more information on categories.
Grade to pass
This setting determines the minimum grade required to pass. The value is used in activity and course completion, and in the gradebook, where pass grades are highlighted in green and fail grades in red.
Blind (Anonymous) marking
Blind marking hides the identity of students to markers. Blind marking settings will be locked once a submission or grade has been made in relation to this assignment. Please note that this setting should not be used in conjunction with the
notify graders
settings as this will reveal the students’ identity via the emails sent. If you have enabled blind marking, you will need to click
reveal student identities
in order to release grades and feedback to students. Do not reveal student identities until the grading process is complete as this option cannot be re-enabled.
Use marking workflow
We recommend using Groups under
Common module settings
to
Facilitating multiple markers
. This requires less manual intervention than the settings
Use Marking workflow
and
Use marking allocation
.
If this setting is set to
Yes
, marks will go through a series of workflow stages before being released to students. This allows for multiple rounds of marking and allows marks to be released to all students at the same time.
Use marking allocation
If enabled together with marking workflow, markers can be allocated to particular students.

--- PAGE: Restrict access for activity, resource or section ---
URL: https://apiit.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ITSM/pages/221089100/Restrict+access+for+activity+resource+or+section

You can use the
Restrict access
settings to control the availability of learning materials based on any one or more of these condition(s). You may also combine the use of these conditions to add a set of nested restrictions to apply complex logic.
Students’ completion of a previous activity
Date (you can set from and until dates)
Students’ grades for a previous assessed activity in the module
Group setting in the module
User Profile field (e.g. First name, email).
You can restrict access to

, or to

.
How to apply Restrict Access to your resource, activity, or section?
When you create a resource or activity, or edit a section summary, you will find the
Restrict access
settings near the end of the settings page. Expand the settings by clicking on it.
Click on the
Add restriction…
button, a choice of conditions appears.
What conditions are available for restriction?
Condition
Image
Meaning
Activity Completion
Activity Completion is enabled by default on new modules. If you are working on a pre- 2019/20 module you will need to enable Completion Tracking from
Settings>>Edit settings
. Once you have set up Activity completion on an activity or resource, Activity completion becomes an option available from the
Add restriction
menu.
You can use the
Activity completion (https://docs.moodle.org/38/en/Activity_completion)
settings to define what constitutes completion. Restrict access in combination with Activity completion
means that you can require that students view certain resources or complete certain activities before moving on to others.
Activity completion Example…
Date
Access can be restricted from or until a certain date and time.
Grade
You can specify a condition on any grade in the course: the full course grade, or the grade for any activity in the module. You can enter either a minimum value (at least percentage), a maximum value (less than percentage), both, or neither by clicking on the relevant checkbox.
Grade Example…
Groups
If
Groups and Groupings (https://apiit.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ITSM/pages/221089121/Groups+and+Groupings)
are set up in the module, it is possible to restrict the activity or resource to a certain group or grouping (which is a cluster of groups). If you choose the option ‘Any group’, the resource/activity will be available to a student who has been assigned to a group (any group). It should not be misinterpreted as students who are not associated with any group.
Groups Example…
User Profile
Every user account in Moodle has profile fields like name, city, country, etc. You can select to restrict the availability of materials base on a student’s Moodle identity. Some useful profile fields are:
First name
Email address
This data is drawn from our student record system – GIMS and is recorded in specific coding. Please liaise with your course office if you want to utilize these fields.
User Profile Example…
Restriction set
This allows you to add a set of nested restrictions combining the use of the above conditions in order to achieve a more complex logic.
How to choose ALL or ANY conditions?
If you add more than one restriction, you can decide if all the conditions need to be met or only some of them.
Relationship
Image
Meaning
ALL
ALL the conditions need to be met. These are AND conditions.
ANY
ANY of the conditions are required before the activity is made available. These are OR conditions.
For example - referral student can be restricted by:
User Profile -> email address -> start with ->Student id (small letter: tp088393)
What will students see if a resource, activity or section has Restrict Access applied?
No matter which condition setting you have chosen, you can choose to either grey out/hide the activity/resource.completely. To set these options, you use the eye icon next to the condition:
Icon
Image
Meaning
Shut-eye
If the eye is SHUT then students who do not meet that part of the condition will not see the activity at all.
Open-eye
If the eye is OPEN the students who do not meet that part of the condition will see the activity but it will be greyed out and have information about why they can’t access it yet.
The shut-eye takes precedence. For example, you could have two conditions, one based on date (with eye shut) and one based on completing a previous activity (with eye open). The activity will not appear for students until the date; then it will be visible with information for students explaining that they need to complete an activity before they can access the materials. When students complete the activity they can access the resources.
Example student view with open-eye for restrictions:
Student id has to be small letter (tp088393)

URL: https://apiit.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ITSM/pages/221089121/Groups+and+Groupings

Groups:
You can assign different group modes to activities within Moodle which will shape how that activity behaves. For groups to work correctly all students must be assigned to a group.
For example, applying a group mode under
Common module settings
within Assignments enables different markers to filter the submissions between groups. This means that the lecturer can view and mark the submissions in the group they are responsible for marking.
Within collaborative activities such as Forums or Wikis, the group mode under
Common module settings
can be used to engage students in group work ( i.e each group has their own collaborative workspace).
The assignment tool also offers an option from
Group assignment settings
for students to submit one piece of work on behalf of their group and for you to assign the same mark and feedback to the entire group. This is available under
Groups
can be used to define which group can access an activity or resource.  If you want to restrict an activity or resource to ensure that only students in a group can access it, select
Group
under
Restrict access
when setting up the activity. The activity or resource will be visible to all students but only accessible to those in the group. If you want the activity or resource to be hidden completely from students who are not in the relevant group, click the eye next to Group.
Groupings:
Groupings are collections of groups. If a student is in more than one group, or you want a subset of groups to work on an activity, you will need to use Groupings for the Groups to work correctly on the activity.

Tutor Group 1 & Project Group B
I want a collaborative workspace for each Project Group to communicate with their Project Group.
Set up a Grouping called Project Grouping and add the following groups to this grouping
Project Group A
Project Group B
Project Group C
Project Group D
Under Common module settings apply separate group mode and select the Project grouping.
Each Project Group has its own collaborative workspace.
If you had not set up Groupings in this scenario, Moodle would have no way of knowing which groups needed to be attached to the Forum. Joe Bloggs would have had access to two Forums one for Tutor Group 1 and one for Project Group B!
Groups setting in Activities :
Reasons to use Groups
Groups can be used to define how students work or collaborate in activity by choosing different group modes. For example, an assignment can be set up so that each student submits his or her work as an individual or as a group.
Depending on which group mode you choose, activities will behave differently. For example, using groups will allow tutors to filter assignments by groups or in Forums it will enable a group of students to work collaboratively.

. The quiz will automatically close at the set time and date, for example in the screenshot below the test will close on 3 April 2020 at 10 am. If a student forgets to take the quiz in time then, he or she will automatically fail the quiz.
Next, we will set the quiz
Time limit
. Usually, 30 minutes to an hour is enough, but it depends on the complexity of the assessment. In some cases, students may need 3 or 4 hours. When students start answering questions, they see a countdown timer that shows how much time is left, and when the time expires, the quiz is automatically closed. For example, we will set a time limit for 30 minutes for this sample quiz.
The rest of the options in this section can be left as they are by default.
Setting #2: Grade. Set a Passing Grade
With the default settings, your students have an unlimited number of attempts to answer the same question. As a result, a quiz can be passed by a random choice method: they make a mistake and immediately change the answer, and so on until they pass. If you prefer students not to play guessing games, limit the number of attempts, and set a passing score.
Grade to pass
– Set a minimal passing grade. This is the minimum score required to pass a quiz. The pass grades are highlighted in green, and fail grades in red. As there are only two questions in this sample quiz, let’s set one (1) point as the passing grade.
Attempts allowed
– Limit the number of attempts to avoid guessing games. If this is a final exam, you can give just one attempt, and perhaps three for a pop quiz.
Setting #3: Layout. Build a Structure
You can group questions into blocks and place each question on a new page, or all the questions on one page. If all the questions are on one page, students can see the whole quiz at a glance.
Setting #4: Question Behavior. Shuffle Answers
For additional anti-cheat protection, choose
Yes
in the
Shuffle within questions
so that the parts making up each question will be randomly shuffled each time users take the quiz.
Setting #5: Overall Feedback. Provide a Final Comment
The overall feedback is a message which users see after completing the quiz. You can show different text depending on the final score: praise high performers and tell failed students the rules of retaking the quiz.
Step 8 -
Set Maximum Score: Scroll down and click on
Save and Display
.
You will be redirected to a new page that shows the quiz you have just set up. Previously, we set the minimum passing grade for the quiz. Now, we need to indicate the highest score. Click
Edit quiz.
Enter the maximum grade. Since there are only two questions in this sample quiz, the highest score will be two (2) points. Specify the maximum score. In this case, it’s 2 points
Step 9 -
Add Quiz Questions: In Moodle, there are 15 types of questions you can add. We will create two of the most popular question types, True/False and Multiple Choice, so you can master the principles of making quizzes in Moodle and easily create other types of tasks on your own. Click on

The quiz is now ready. All you need to do now is to assign it to students and keep track of their results from the
Grades
tab.
Open a Question Bank:
So far, we have been discussing creating a quiz from scratch. If you are going to conduct regular assessments, it is convenient to use a question bank.
A question bank in Moodle is an overall stock of all the questions and tasks you have ever created on the platform. This feature saves time since there’s no need to create everything from scratch: if you need to prepare a test for a new course, you can simply copy ready-made tasks from the bank.
The two questions we created as a sample are already in the bank; to find them.
Step 1 -
go to the course page and on the top right corner of the page click on
setting gear icon
. A drop down menu list will open and from this list select
More
.
Step 2 -
Click
Question bank
in the new window. On this page, you can create new questions and find the ones you’ve already used. Next time you can try creating questions right on this page and build a new quiz with them.

Please ensure that all the students on your module are in a group before submissions are made. If you do not do this then one student’s assignment submission will become available to all students. All groups must be correct prior to the first submission. Changing group membership after one submission will result in assignments being deleted.
Please refer to our guidance on Adding Groups to your module for more information.
When using group assignments you need to set up and apply groupings in addition to groups. This is because group submissions can disappear if groups are used and a student is in one group and is subsequently added to another group. This setting is to be applied under
step 7
of this guide.
What does the setting require all group members to submit mean?

DECIDED
If set to
Yes
:
If set to
Yes
:
All members of the group have the ability to submit a file on behalf of the group.
Each group member must click the
Submit assignment
button to confirm that this is the final version of the assignment as agreed with the group.
Once a group member has clicked
Submit assignment
, they cannot change their mind and replace the submitted file with any other file even if the assignment deadline has not yet been reached.
Group members who have not clicked
Submit assignmen
t can replace the submitted file with a new file. If the last member of the group to submit, changes the file submission and clicks
Submit assignment
, other members of the group will not be able to change it. The group will need to contact the lecturer or course officer to revert the assignment to Draft (see additional note below).
The assignment is not deemed to be submitted until each of the group members has clicked the
Submit assignment
button.
When one student has submitted, the other members of the group will be able to see who still has to submit.
Click for more information on reverting an assignment to Draft status when ‘
Require all group members submit
’ is set to
Yes
If the assignment is reverted to draft after it has been submitted, the submission status for each student in the group will revert to Draft but it is only the student whose record the lecturer clicked on in the grading action screen to revert the submission who needs to re-submit. The other students will have a Draft status but they will not be included in the list of students who need to submit. If the lecturer then reverts more students in the group, the status for all students in the group will still be Draft but only students whose submission status was clicked to revert the submission will need to re-submit, and not the others in the group. When all those students who need to re-submit have re-submitted, the status of the assignment in the gradebook will be displayed as Submitted for all members of the group.
Step 1-
Create:
Turn editing on
. Open the section you would like to add an assignment in and choose
Add an activity or resource
.Select Assignment from the Activity list and and it will be added(and opened).
Step 2-
General: In the
General
settings, provide a name and a description for your assignment.Check the box if you would like to Show the Description on the module page.If needed, upload the files you would like to attach to this assignment (i.e. assignment cover sheet).
Step 3-
Availability:  In the
Availability
box, select the date the assignment will be available from and the deadline for submissions (Due date).
We recommend that assignment deadlines are set between 9-5 Monday-Friday to ensure educational technology and course office support is available for students who experience problems submitting assignments.The Cut-off date is the date after the deadline that students can submit until. This is useful for managing late submissions. Please note that students who submit until the deadline can edit their assignment if the cut-off date has not yet been reached.The Remind me to grade by date appears in Module Events & Upcoming Events blocks for staff enrolled on a module to remind them of grading deadlines.
Step 4-
Submission types & accepted file types: In the
Submission types
box, decide whether the submission will be online text or students will upload a file. Typically our assignments are File submissions so no change needs to be made.For a file submission assignment then indicate how many files students can submit from the Maximum number of uploaded files.Accepted file types can be restricted by selecting from a drop-down list. If the field is left empty, then all file types are accepted.
Step 5-
Feedback types: In most cases, you will not need to change the settings in the
Feedback types
box.If you need to review these settings, please refer to the Feedback types of guidance.
Step 6-
Submission settings: In the
Submission settings
box, select Yes in the Require students to click submit button only if you want all members of a group to click the Submit assignment button to confirm that this is the final version of the assignment as agreed with the group.
The setting Require that students accept the submission statement will be enabled by default on assignments. Please do not change this setting as it is important that students understand what is required of them in regards to Academic Integrity Statement prior to submitting an assignment.
Step 7-
Group assignment settings: The Students submit in groups option should be to Yes, to create a group assignment.
Require group to make a submissionSet this to Yes. When a student who is not in a group attempts to submit, Moodle will display a message “You’re not a member of any group; please contact your lecturer”, and the student will not be able to submit the assignment.
Require all group members submitThis setting will only be enabled if you have ticked the “Require students click submit button” earlier.
If Yes is selected, then the assignment will not be classed as “submitted” until all members of the group have submitted.
Grouping for student groups
This setting allows you to select a grouping for your assignment. If students are in more than one group on the module, or may be added to another group later, you will need to select the relevant grouping to manage the group assignment. For example, James Jones is in Project Group A and Lisa’s Personal Tutor Group on your module. If you don’t create an assignment grouping, James will have the option of submitting an assignment to two separate groups, Project Group A and Lisa’s Personal Tutor Group
If a particular grouping is selected here, then the gradebook will display any other groups and non-grouped students in the “default group”.
If “none” is selected, then the gradebook will display the names of all the groups and put any non-grouped students into the “default group”.
Please refer to our guidance on
Groups and Groupings (https://apiit.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ITSM/pages/221089121/Groups+and+Groupings)
for more information.
Step 8-
Notifications : In most cases, you will not need to change the
Notifications
settings
Please refer to the
Assignment – Individual (https://apiit.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ITSM/pages/221088925/Assignment+Individual)
guidance if you require a specific setting for this.
Step 9-
Grade: In the
Grade
section, select the type of grade and the grading method. The most common settings are point and simple direct grading.
If you need to use the more advance settings:
Please refer to the guidance on how to use scales as grades, and Marking Record and Grades as grading methods.
Please refer to the guidance on Facilitating multiple markers and anonymous marking if you need to set a process with several markers or blind marking.
Due to the way that groups are managed in Moodle, it is not possible to have an anonymous group assignment as the group name displays in the assignment submission area. This means that lecturers who may have set up the groups can differentiate between the submissions or can go to the groups in Moodle to see the group members via Settings >Users > Groups.
Step 10-
Common settings: In the
Common module settings
, you can decide if you want to show or hide your assignment using the Availability settings. You do not need to change the group mode, this is managed from Group assignment settings in step 7.
You can skip the Restrict access section. If you need to add restrictions, please refer to the Restrict access guidance.
Click on
Save and display
and check that your assignment is setup as intended.

--- PAGE: Set up a Moodle Marking Record ---
URL: https://apiit.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ITSM/pages/221153297/Set+up+a+Moodle+Marking+Record

A marking record is very similar to a rubric, but it’s simpler.
For each marking criterion, a comment explains what is being sought, and provides a maximum mark that can be awarded. Students can view the marking criteria before they submit so that they know what their learning priorities are in relation to the assignment.
When you come to marking you can view the criteria and add in your comments and grades for each criterion as well as use the ‘frequently added comments’ function. Marking using a marking record is more detailed and less subjective than awarding a single grade.
Marking Record should match the assessment criteria available to students for a specific module assignment.
Assignment criteria explains what a student needs to demonstrate in order to complete an assessment successfully.
Assessment criteria will differ according to the discipline, the type of assessment and the level of students.
note
Marking record do not have to be completed online, ensure all your markers are able to mark offline.

--- PAGE: Assessment Overview ---
URL: https://apiit.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ITSM/pages/221153318/Assessment+Overview

Assessment and feedback are at the heart of the student experience, shaping students’ understanding of the curriculum, and influencing student progress on the programme and career choices. The assessment also forms a significant part of the workload for academics and administrators and yet is an area that is often rated unsatisfactory by students. (JISC, 2010)
When setting assessment deadlines online, we recommend that deadlines are set between 9-5 Monday-Friday to ensure educational technology, technology, and course office support is available for students who experience problems with their online assessment. Review the Module Page Checklist: Assessment Information on Module Page for requirements around online assessment.
E-Assessment benefits
Using technology can bring many benefits to the assessment process and some of these are outlined below:
Greater variety and authenticity in the design of assessments
Improved learner engagement, for example through interactive formative assessments with adaptive feedback
Choice in the timing and location of assessments
Capture of wider skills and attributes not easily assessed by other means, for example through simulations, e-portfolios and interactive games
Efficient submission, marking, moderation and data storage processes
Consistent, accurate results with opportunities to combine human and computer marking
Immediate feedback
Increased opportunities for learners to act on  feedback, for example by reflection in e-portfolios
Innovative approaches based around the use of creative media and online peer and self-assessment
Accurate, timely and accessible evidence on the effectiveness of curriculum design and delivery

#FFFAE6
Moodle offers many different styles of assessment, from quizzes to peer assessment to video assignments.
Quiz
The
Quiz
activity allows you to design and build quizzes consisting of a large variety of question types, including multiple-choice, true-false, and short answer questions. Questions are kept in the Question Bank and can be re-used in quizzes in different modules. Moodle Quiz can help to build students’ confidence by providing opportunities for them to consolidate their learning, and offering instant personalized feedback. Lecturers can also benefit from using quizzes to identify parts of the curriculum that students are struggling with and to gather feedback about the content covered in lectures. Moodle Quiz activity supports diagnostic and formative assessment as well as summative exams.
Assignment Guide
There are three separate assignment activities in Moodle – Turnitin, Moodle, and Video assignment. Assignment activities in Moodle enable students to submit their coursework as a file upload or online text and allows the Lecturer to assess, grade and provide feedback. Our Assignment Guide outlines the functionality of each activity to help you to select a tool that meets your requirements.
Peer Assessment Guide
Peer assessment is the assessment of students’ work by their peers against set assessment criteria. By assessing or evaluating each other’s work, students take up the role of appraisers and, over time, acquire the skills they need to make judgments on their own work. In general, there are two types of peer assessments:
Assessment of team contribution in group work – members of a group assess the performance of their peers in terms of their contribution to the group’s work.
Assessment of coursework undertaken by other students – students provide feedback/grades on their peers’ work.
In either case, self-assessment may be included as part of peer assessment. Self-assessment requires students to reflect on their own work and judge how well they have performed in relation to the assessment criteria. Developing reflective skills provides students with the ability to consider their own performance and to identify their strengths, weaknesses, and areas that require improvement. Students can then use this knowledge to influence their future work, whether on a program of study or in employment.
Moodle has two peer assessment activities and also the Database and Forum activity which can be used to support Peer Assessment. Our Peer Assessment Guide outlines the functionality of each activity to help you select a tool that meets your requirements
Forum
The Forum activity allows students and lecturers to exchange ideas by posting comments as part of a ‘thread’. The Forum can be used for formative and summative assessments that require students to communicate, collaborate, debate or critique.
Wiki
A wiki is a collaboratively designed webpage or series of webpages. Each time a person makes changes to a wiki page, their revision of the content becomes the current version, and an older version is stored. Edits can be reverted if necessary. Wikis can be used for formative and summative assessments that require students to collaborate and co-create content.
