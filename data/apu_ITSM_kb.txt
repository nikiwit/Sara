Information security is everyone's responsibility!
If you receive a message that passed through spam filtering that should have been identified as spam/junk or phishing, you can submit the message to the Microsoft Spam Analysis and Microsoft Phishing Analysis teams as appropriate. The analysts will review the message and add it to the service-wide filters if it meets the classification criteria:
Create a new, blank email message with one of the following recipients:
If a
junk/spam
email:
junk@office365.microsoft.com (https://apiit.atlassian.net/wiki/wiki/mailto:junk@office365.microsoft.com)
If a
phishing
email:
phish@office365.microsoft.com (https://apiit.atlassian.net/wiki/wiki/mailto:phish@office365.microsoft.com)
2. Drag and drop the junk or phishing message into the new message. This will save the junk or phishing message as an attachment in the new message. Don't copy and paste the content of the message or forward the message (Microsoft  needs the original message so they can inspect the message header)
note
You can attach multiple messages in the new message. Make sure that all the messages are the same type: either phishing scam messages or junk email messages.
Leave the body of the new message empty.
Use either .msg (default Outlook format) or .eml (default Outlook on the Web format) formats for the attached messages.

FAQ - (Frequently Asked Questions)
What is Phishing ?
A phishing attempt is an email that seeks to lure the recipient into divulging passwords, financial account numbers or other personal information, or into going to a website rigged to commandeer the recipient's computer. While some of these emails are easy to identify, many are difficult to discern because they appear authentic down to the last detail.
What is a Junk/Spam email?
Spamming refers to the practice of flooding the inboxes with an unsolicited email addressed to many recipients in an attempt to force the message on people who would not otherwise choose to receive it.
How do spammers/attacker get my address?
E-mail spam lists are often created by scanning stealing mailing list addresses or by searching the web for addresses. Online directories are another source of e-mail addresses. The more internet activity you participate in with your email address, the more likely you'll end up in a spam list.

Introduction
OBE has been out in the wild for a few months and has been used extensively for any classes that start from 1st of June 2020. In this event, we’ve seen drastic adaptation by Lecturers across APU and APIIT to use OBE as their main System where they can do the Mark Entry for their classes.
All of us from the Centre of Technology & Innovation (CTI) highly appreciate all the countless effort by all the Lecturers involved throughout the entire journey till today.

Scenarios (FAQ) - OBE Briefing questionnaires.
Why is my class not converted automatically to VD1-AA as soon as it was made available?
The main reason behind we’re converting the Classes to AA by batches automatically prevents any form of issues or complications that may be caused. We filter them by priority list (Due to be Moderated soon, and more). However, if you would like your Class to be converted earlier, please do send a ticket to us through the
Virtual Help Centre (https://apiit.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portals)
and we will assist with the conversion as soon as possible.
Why can’t I view my classes?
If a class was recently assigned to you from a different Lecturer in GIMS by Admin, open a ticket through the
Virtual Help centre (https://apiit.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portals)
for the assignee's change. This process is yet to be automated, but as OBE grows, we expect all these small processes to be automated. For the time being, we do understand that this is tedious, but we assure you that this will be resolved as soon as possible. We’d also like to stress that the Access Control in OBE is done as per who it is assigned to in GIMS.

is designed for you to help you in the process of opening a ticket.
What is the usual process/pipeline for the Course version conversion? (VD1 → VD1-AA)
Right upon writing a ticket through
Virtual Help Centre (https://apiit.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portals)
, we evaluate the changes that need to be done. However, in most cases, if any Marks entered in the system before the conversion, it will need to be wiped. This is due to the Assessment Scheme changes, the previous scheme (VD1) and the new scheme (VD1-AA).
Can I use Safari or Internet Explorer to access OBE?
No, the usage of Safari or Internet Explorer is not recommended. We will be restricting access for unsupported browsers soon. We highly suggest the usage of Firefox or Chrome.
If our alternative assessment evolves with different criteria, then are we allowed to create another version of course descriptor for ongoing or future intakes?
Yes, you may create a separate Course version for this case, and the new Course version can be used on future intakes. However, we do not recommend editing the Assessment Scheme Layout for an ongoing class.
This section that's being discussed - adding a new course for this course. Do all lecturers have the access privilege to do this?
Yes, all lecturers have the required permission to create the Course version. However,
ONLY
ALs should be creating the Course version.
Is there any "Help" feature or Quick Reference available on how to execute each function Or in case there is a problem - Is there Help function available
We do not have a "Help" button in the System, but you may use this Guide as our comprehensive guide on the System.
If we change the total raw marks, it will reflect and wipe out from the previous data. What version should I put in the OBE? Say that it is VD1. Should it be changed to VD1.1 even no changes made in the MD?
If you would like to change the Raw Marks for your Assessment Component, you may raise a ticket with us for the amendment - Change of Raw Mark does not need you to wipe the entire Marks Entry in the Class.
Does OBE have all the Subjects updated?
Yes, all Subjects are directly synchronized from GIMS. Hence, they are updated.
Do I need to create a new Programme Map if I were to amend the map each time?
If the amendment is minor, you are allowed to edit the map directly. However, if the amendments are not minor, we require you to create a new Programme Map.
Is there a way to remove the Tutorial class codes from this view?
Yes, we are in the work of removing all the Tutorial Classes from the View.
Does SAR creation depend on clicking the Finalization button?
Yes, when you click on the "Finalise" button. That is when the Marks from OBE are sent/synchronized to GIMS.
Can Module Leaders access their respective subjects even though they are not teaching the module?
Yes, however, we are working on a new set of Access Control for PLs to access the Marks efficiently. Please stay tuned.
We will have to key in using VD1-AA or VD1?
If your Class has adapted "Alternative Assessment", then your Class should be used "VD1-AA". Please liaise with your AL for further clarification.
What happened to all marks that have been finalised if at all marks changes due to the moderation process? It could be an increase or decrease in marks.
In this case, the Assessment Team will notify CTI on the Class's release for the amendment of the Marks.
Is there any way to obtain the marks directly from Moodle to OBE system?
We are currently working on this implementation; this feature will be made available by the 1st quarter of 2021. Please stay tuned.
May I know why the list of students not same as in attendance? Its either have extra or might not in the OBE list
The main reason behind this is because either the Student was added or dropped in the middle of the Course. We are actively working on a solution for this.
Let's say there were students who didn't attend any of the incourse and final exam so will the system accept the 0 marks?
Yes, the System will allow "0" marks. This is the default mark.

Why my device unable to detect   OnBoard@APU,  Student@APU 2.0  and Staff@APU 2.0 SSID but able to detect Wireless@APU  ?
Answer
-
Onboard@APU,  Student@APU 2.0  and Staff@APU 2.0 are configured to provide a 5GHz connection and therefore can only connect on the 5GHz frequency. In some cases, manufacturers elect not to install dual-band radios in their devices. If you have attempted unsuccessfully to connect to these SSID  or cannot find the network, it may be because your device contains only a 2.4GHz radio. In order to assure APU  Wi-Fi connection for these devices, the Wireless@APU SSID was created.
As an important reminder, if you can use Onboard@APU,  Student@APU 2.0  or  Staff@APU SSID, you should. You will experience better wireless performance.
Is it possible to add 5 GHz capabilities to my 2.4 GHz-only computer?
Answer
-
Yes! If you want to make your computer capable of connecting to the 5 GHz frequency, the easiest way is to purchase a wireless adapter. We recommends that you purchase an 802.11ac USB wireless adapter such as
AC1300 MU-MIMO Wi-Fi Nano USB Adapter (https://www.dlink.com/en/products/dwa-181-ac1300-mu-mimo-wi-fi-nano-usb-adapter)
(typically less than $100 online).
I’ve gotten an error in CloudPath app (requires that your organization has a proper server).
Answer -
This is because you have not to click the Authentication Agent link. Kindly refer to Step 5 of the article on How-To-Connect (based on your particular device type) and access the page with Authentication Agent and click on Install The Network.
I am using iOS (iPhone) and after downloading the WiFi Agent, it is not connecting to the new SSID Student 2.0
Answer -
At times, the WiFi profile after being download and installed the SSID needs to be manually connected. Please follow the steps mentioned in the image below or following Step 16 in the
guideline
.
Can I connect to Onboard@APU or Student@APU 2.0 or  Staff@APU 2.0 from APU Satellite Campus Residence?
Answer
-
No. The new WiFi service (Onboard@APU / Student@APU 2.0 / Staff@APU 2.0) is currently enabled  only at APU and APIIT campuses. However,
APU Satellite Campus Residence (http://www.apu.edu.my/life-apu/accommodation/satellite-campus-residence-tpm)
is still using the the legacy WiFi system. Therefore, please connect  to BYOD@APU (recommended) or Wireless@APU to get connected to the WiFi Internet from
APU Satellite Campus Residence (http://www.apu.edu.my/life-apu/accommodation/satellite-campus-residence-tpm)
.
I have more than 4 Devices, what do i do?
Answer
-
Onboard@APU supports a maximum of 4 devices per user at the moment. So if you would want to register another device, you will have to de-register/delete an old device and register the new device. Please see the
guideline (https://apiit.atlassian.net/wiki/wiki/spaces/ITSM/pages/682688709)
to learn how to manage your device.
How do i connect to other devices like PS (PlayStation) Series, XBox Series, Nintendo?
Residents of
APU on-campus accommodation (http://www.apu.edu.my/life-apu/accommodation/campus-accommodation)
can register a game console and/or digital media device (such as smart TVs,
PS (PlayStation) Series, XBox Series and  Nintendo
) for use on the on-campus network. If you have a wireless-capable device that does not support the WPA2 Enterprise protocol used by the Student@APU 2.0 or Wireless@APU networks, then you should submit a support ticket on
https://apiit.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portals (https://apiit.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portals)
or email
assist@apu.edu.my (https://apiit.atlassian.net/wiki/wiki/mailto:assist@apu.edu.my)

--- PAGE: Is forwarding an email to respective Virtual Help Centre service desk same as creating ticket on behalf of the reporter? ---
URL: https://apiit.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ITSM/pages/615645185/Is+forwarding+an+email+to+respective+Virtual+Help+Centre+service+desk+same+as+creating+ticket+on+behalf+of+the+reporter

No, it is not same as creating ticket on behalf of the reporter.
We recommend to use Jira Cloud Outlook add-in to change an email enquiry to a ticket -
Create ticket from Outlook
Why? Let’s look at a case scenario below to better understand.
For example; You are an agent for Academic Administration service desk and you receive an email enquiry to your work email inbox from a student. When you forward this email to
admin@apu.edu.my (https://apiit.atlassian.net/wiki/wiki/mailto:admin@apu.edu.my)
, it will create a ticket on Virtual Help Centre - Academic Administration. The reporter of this ticket enquiry will be you because the email forwarder (sender) to
admin@apu.edu.my (https://apiit.atlassian.net/wiki/wiki/mailto:admin@apu.edu.my)
is from your email address that created ticket instead of student email.
Even though you can change the reporter after ticket creation on Agent Portal from your email to student email, the student will not know that you have created a ticket on behalf of the student on Virtual Help Centre - Academic Administration, only if you reply to the ticket. The first time a ticket is created on Virtual Help Centre, it will send email notification to reporter that a ticket have been created but, in this case it will send this notification to you because originally this ticket was created with your email address (email forwarder). See the screenshot of ticket history below.
As you can see that ticket was originally created by
ismail@staffemail.apu.edu.my
and the user received email notification that a ticket have been created. Later, this ticket reporter is changed from
ismail@staffemail.apu.edu.my
to
Mohammad Reza Ganji
and as mentioned above the new reporter will not receive notification because
Mohammad Reza Ganji
is not original reporter of this ticket.
Therefore, we recommend to use Jira Cloud Oulook add-in to create ticket on behalf of the reporter (email sender) to avoid any conflict about reporter. Follow this guide to know;

--- PAGE: Why does my Turnitin Assignment show a ‘Read Only’ mode? ---
URL: https://apiit.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ITSM/pages/340918273/Why+does+my+Turnitin+Assignment+show+a+Read+Only+mode

You may have tried to access a Turnitin Assignment in order to provide feedback, or grade a submission.
A student may have tried to submit a paper.
However,  you are prevented from doing so since the class has apparently expired and is currently ‘read only’.
Why does this message appear?
When a Teacher creates a Turnitin assignment (using the Moodle Direct v2 plugin) for the first time within a Moodle course, a Turnitin class is also created for that course on the Turnitin database. This class has a default end date which is typically six months from the creation date, or it is set to the date of the latest post-date for the Turnitin assignments in the class. Once the end date is reached, the class becomes “expired,” which means any submissions in the class are read-only.
Any student enrolled in an expired class will NOT count against the Institution’s Turnitin student limit.
How do I change the class from ‘expired’ to ‘active’?
It is not possible to change the default class end date in the Moodle integration. However you can take the following steps to extend the class end date so the class becomes active once more:
Step 1 -
Login to Moodle
Step 2 -
Navigate to the relevant Moodle course
Step 3 -
Open the relevant Turnitin assignment in the course
Step 4 -
Edit the Post Date to a date in the future.  This will cause the class end date to be extended so the class becomes active again.
Step 5 -
Change the post date back to whatever you would like it to be.

--- PAGE: Insert links and anchors ---
URL: https://apiit.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ITSM/pages/328302625/Insert+links+and+anchors

Send your readers to the right spot by using one of Confluence's content links. You can link to pages or to content on a page, like comments.
This section details how links can be added to pages without the use of adding anchors.
Insert links
Either highlight the text to be used as the link and click the link tool, or just click the link tool.
Clicking the link tool gives you the ability to paste a link or search for recently viewed Confluence blogs or pages; the pages can be from any space in your Confluence site. After establishing the destination of the link, you can modify the text that is displayed to page viewers.
Link formats
Depending on the destination of your link, there are a variety of ways to get the right URL.
Description
How to find and use
Link to external sites, Confluence blogs, or Confluence pages
Navigate to the page whose link you want to use.
Copy the URL.
Paste the URL in the link tool pop-up where ever you want it to appear on the page, and give it a more friendly name if desired.
Link to a page comment in a Confluence blog or page
Navigate to the page whose link you want to use.
Locate the page comment.
Click the date link below the comment. The page reloads scrolling you to the comment.
Copy the URL.
Navigate to and edit the page where you want to link to the comment.
Paste the URL in the link tool pop-up where ever you want it to appear on the page, and give it a more friendly name if desired.
Link to an inline comment in a Confluence blog or page
Navigate to the page whose link you want to use.
Locate the inline page comment, and click to open the pop-up.
Click the date link below the comment. The page reloads scrolling you to the comment.
Copy the URL.
Navigate to and edit the page where you want to link to the comment.
Paste the URL in the link tool pop-up and give it a more friendly name if desired.
Link to an email address
Navigate to the page where you want to link to the email.
Type the email address in the link tool pop-up where ever you want it to appear on the page, and give it a more friendly name if desired. Confluence automatically creates a 'mailto:' link.
Link to a page’s attachment
Doing this through the link tool is
coming soon (https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-65302)
. In the meanwhile, you can use this process to accomplish your goal.
Navigate to the published version of the page containing the attachment to which you want to link.
Go to More ••• > Attachments.
Right-click on the file name of the attachment, and select Copy Link Address.
Navigate to and edit the page where you want to link to the attachment.
Paste the URL in the link tool pop-up, and give it a more friendly name if desired.
Link to the latest version of an attachment on another page
Navigate to the published version of the page containing the attachment to which you want to link.
Go to More ••• > Attachments.
Right-click on the file name of the attachment, and select Copy Link Address.
Navigate to and edit the page where you want to link to the attachment.
Paste the URL in the link tool pop-up, remove any text after the file extension in the URL, and give it a more friendly name if desired.
Link to a heading on a page or another page
Heading links use a combination of the three character space identifier and the page ID along with the page name and header name.
If you only need to get the URL that takes viewers to a heading, do the following:
Navigate to the page and scroll down to the heading.
Hover over the heading to reveal the link icon to the left of the heading.
Click the link icon to copy the link.
Navigate to and edit the page where you want to link to the heading.
Paste the URL in the link tool pop-up, and give it a more friendly name if desired.
If you need to create several links to headings on a page, it’s more efficient to get the page URL and construct the heading portion yourself.
Navigate to and view the page containing the heading.
Copy the page URL for future use. Keep in mind that the page URL capitalization must match the page title capitalization. Spaces in the page title are replaced with a plus ( + ).
Make note of all the exact headings that to which you want to link.
Navigate to and edit the page where you want to link to the headings.
Paste the page URL in the link tool pop-up, add the page heading title, and give it a more friendly name if desired. Keep in mind that the heading part of the URL must match the capitalization of the page heading. Spaces in the heading title are replaced with a hyphen ( - ).
Repeat Step 6 until you’ve created all the heading links needed.
yoursite.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/AAA/pages/#####/Page+title+goes+here#Page-heading-goes-here (http://yoursite.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/AAA/pages/#####/Page+title+goes+here#Page-heading-goes-here)
Link to a Jira issue
(where Confluence and Jira are connected)
Navigate to the Jira issue.
Navigate to and edit the page where you want to link to the attachment.
Paste the URL onto the page. Confluence automatically converts this to a smart link that displays the issue number, summary text, and status.
Creating links to non-heading sections of your page isn't possible in the new editor. If you need to link to a part of the page that isn’t worthy of a major heading, try using a smaller heading like an H5 or H6.
Linking to text formatted as headings in tables isn’t currently possible in the new editor.

What is it?
The Moodle course Gradebook (or Grader report as it is also known)
allows tutors and course administrators to manage grades for Moodle activities, such as assignments and quizzes, in that course. The Gradebook collects items that have been graded from the various assessed activities in Moodle and allows you to view and change them, as well as sort grade items into categories and calculate totals in various ways. When you add an assessed activity in a Moodle course, the Gradebook automatically creates space for the grades it will produce and then adds the grades as they are generated, either by the system (e.g. quizzes) or by you (e.g. assignments). Many activities in Moodle can be graded, including glossary and database entries (using ratings), lessons, quizzes, assignments, questionnaires, SCORM/AICC packages and scheduler meetings.
Why use it?
To manage and view all student grades for a particular module.
To define the way grades are displayed to students - e.g. letter grades, percentages, scale grades etc.
Who can use it?
Tutors or course administrators can use the Gradebook to view and manage grades.
Students can use the Gradebook to view their own grades only.
Before I start...
:info:

#FFFAE6
When viewing the Gradebook there are three different types of reports you can view:
1. Grader Report
The
Grader
report
is shown by default and shows each student down the left side and each category, gradable activity and grade for the current Moodle course along the top of the page. The list of students can be sorted using the arrows alongside each activity name. Clicking the name of the activity will take you to the student's attempts for that activity, assuming there are some. The course total displays to the far right, so you may need to scroll down and to the right to see this.
2. User Report
The
User
report
is what students see by default and shows the grade, percentage and feedback for each activity in the course. To view a student's grades, choose their name from the
Select all or one user
drop down menu on the right. You can filter by user to see the grades for any of your students. To view all the students' grades on one page (one after the other) select
All users
from the menu.
3. Overview Report
The
Overview
report
is only available for students and lists all the Moodle courses they are enrolled on, with their total grade for each. If they click on the Course name, they will see all the grade items and grades for that course (this will take them to the
User report
). To see this report for yourself click on the
Settings
menu (to the left of the page) and expand
Switch role to....
then click
Student
. You will need to
select a user
from the drop-down menu on the right of the page (don't worry, students only see their own grades). Once you have finished seeing (roughly) what students see, click
return to my normal role
in the top, right corner of the page.
Students
can see their
own grades
for each activity providing it is not hidden. Grades can be
hidden
in the Gradebook and within the settings for that activity (e.g. Quizzes allow you to hide Scores from students). If you don't want your students to see grades ensure they are hidden in both the activity and the grade book.
How do I...?
1. Access the Gradebook
To access the Gradebook in your Moodle course, go to the Settings block and under Course, administration click on Grades.

2. Add an additional grade item
When importing a spreadsheet of data you can select for grades to be added to a
new grade item
.
Alternatively, in the Gradebook, under the
Setup tab
, you can click
Add grade item

Step 5 -
Click
save changes

Further help
Further guidance on Grader report (Gradebook) is available from Moodle Docs. (https://docs.moodle.org/38/en/Grader_report)
If you find any inaccurate or missing information you can even update this yourself (it's a communal wiki).
In case of further inquiry, please open a ticket with the
Virtual Help Centre (https://apiit.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portals)
. Alternatively, you may choose to access APSpace > More >
Help Centre (https://apiit.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portals)

is designed for you to help you in the process of opening a ticket.
Caution
You may need to hide all the grades in your course, to prevent students seeing them before ratification.
You can do this by following these steps:
The
Categories and items
tab allows you to organise your grade items and aggregate grades using various methods for all the items in that category. A top-level category with the name of the Moodle course is added by default to the Gradebook and cannot be deleted. More information about grade categories is available in the next section of this document.
You can
hide all grades
Examples and case studies
Conditional (if, and, or) operators can be used in grade calculations of the grade book. This can be used to specify a grade below which certain activities must not fall.

What if I am not able to install additional software on my computer?
760
Your university has decided to use the Lockdown Browser for all future exams. You will need to have your device checked by CTI to confirm that software cannot be installed. CTI will provide the necessary assistance.
How do I mitigate any system updates during the exam ?
760
By verifying and updating the below components beforehand, you can mitigate the risk of any unforeseen updates or technical issues that may arise during the exam. Taking these steps will help ensure a stable and reliable exam environment, allowing you to focus on your assessments without interruptions.
Laptop System Updates: Please check for and install any pending system updates for your laptop. Keeping your operating system up to date will help prevent unexpected interruptions or restarts during the exam.
Windows Updates: Verify that your Windows operating system is updated to the latest version. Regular Windows updates provide important security patches and improvements that can enhance the performance of your system during the exam.
Lockdown Browser Update: Make sure you have the latest version of Respondus Lockdown Browser installed and updated in your laptop. Visit the Respondus website from the following links only which is dedicated for APU then install the most recent version of Lockdown Browser. This will ensure compatibility and access to all the necessary features during the exam:

What am I allowed to bring into the exam hall?
760
You are allowed to bring ONLY your laptop and charger into the exam hall. All other paraphernalia, if necessary, will be provided by the Exam Unit. If your exam requires the use of a calculator, your lecturer will enable the laptop calculator to be used with Lockdown Browser. Formula booklet (if required for your exam) will be provided by the exam unit as well.
Will Lockdown Browser interfere with my computer settings?
760
Generally, Lockdown Browser will install and run with no issues on a standard laptop with factory settings. In the event your device is modified with certain performance enhancing, remote access or screen recording apps, or you have modified settings on your device, there may be issues. For first time users, please ensure you attend the MOCK exam conducted by your lecturer so that any such issues can be identified and rectified.
Can spreadsheets be used with Lockdown Browser?
760
Lockdown Browser includes a basic spreadsheet tool that enables .xls/.xlsx spreadsheets to be viewed and manipulated during an exam session. This functionality is available for Windows, Mac, and iPad editions of Lockdown Browser.
Within the quiz tool of the learning system, an instructor should add a link to the spreadsheet in the question wording. Exactly how this link is determined and then added to the question differs with each LMS. In most cases, you should:
Upload the spreadsheet to a content area in the course.
In the content area, right click on the spreadsheet title and choose "copy link location" (wording will vary depending on the browser used).
Paste that link directly into the quiz question.
However, these steps may not work for every LMS.  Some LMS types offer a document uploading tool right in the essay question toolbar, and if so, this would be the preferred method to embed the file.
The .csv file type is not supported. Please convert this file type to .xls/.xlsx before attempting to use it with Lockdown Browser.
When a student selects the link within Lockdown Browser, a spreadsheet tool will open.  The spreadsheet can be pre-populated with content, or it can be a blank spreadsheet created in another spreadsheet app, which students use to prepare their answers.
As an example, the spreadsheet tool might be used with a multiple-choice question. As shown below, a link provides access to a pre-populated spreadsheet. The student calculates the answer and then selects one of the answer choices.
The image below shows the spreadsheet that was used for this exam question.
Alternatively, an instructor can require students to create or modify a spreadsheet and submit it for grading. The example below shows how an essay question can be used for this purpose.
The question wording itself should provide guidance on the steps a student should follow. As shown above, students are instructed to 1) select the link that opens a pre-populated spreadsheet, 2) create the required formula or calculation, 3) select the button “Click here to save your work”, and 4) paste the resulting URL into the answer field for the essay question.
After the spreadsheet file has been saved, a dialog will remind students to copy the resulting URL to the answer field using CTRL + V.
Following the exam, the instructor will see a unique URL within the LMS for each student who provided an answer for the essay question. Upon selecting the URL with a standard browser (not Lockdown Browser), the spreadsheet tool will open and the student’s work will be shown for that question.
Note: the spreadsheet tool is not available for the McGraw-Hill ALEKS or Pearson MyLab integrations.
What happens if the internet connection is poor, and I lose connectivity?
760
APU has subscribed to and installed a new dedicated SSID for the exam halls and we do not anticipate any downtime. However, you can do your part by ensuring that your device is not running any additional applications that use Wi-Fi. By default, open applications will be turned off by Lockdown Browser once it starts running.
What can I do if my laptop runs out of battery?
760
APU has installed over 100 power supply points at each desk in the exam hall. You can plug in to the point right below your desk for supply for your device. Please ensure you have your device charger with you at all times when you have exams.
Will I get time to setup my laptop and to show my work through the camera device after the exam?
760
You will be allowed to enter the exam hall 30 minutes before start of the exam. We will need to verify your identity through a facial recognition device after which you can setup your laptop. After the exam, you will be given 15 minutes to show your work to the camera on your device.
For Math and Engineering exams, do we need to answer in the Moodle platform?
760
The exam questions will be provided via the Moodle link which would have been setup by your lecturer, however the exam answers have to be written in the answer booklet, provided by the exam unit. The answer booklet will later be collected from you after you have completed the Show Work option.

Troubleshooting
General
Blank exam/quiz after launching Lockdown Browser
760
This is due to the customized Moodle theme settings. To change back your Moodle theme to Default, perform the following:
Login to Moodle:
https://lms2.apiit.edu.my/my/ (https://lms2.apiit.edu.my/my/)
Click on the profile at the top right and click
Preferences
.
Under User account, click
Edit profile
.
Under General, look for Preferred theme, then change it to
Default
.
Scroll down and click
Update profile
.
Launch the exam/quiz on Lockdown Browser again.
Exam/quiz tabs keeps loading but it never load
760
F-Secure Internet Security is known to cause this issue due to their Deep Guard over-blocking the network. Try adding Lockdown Browser into the exception list and try again.
Windows
When attempting exam, I received "Blocked Application Detected" message
760
Some antivirus applications are flagged by Lockdown Browser as "blocked application". If following applications are installed, please consider uninstalling them:
Avast Antivirus
AVG Antivirus
When attempting exam, I received "Yikes! A VM has been detected" message
760
If you encounter this error even if you have not installed Lockdown Browser in an operating system that is running on Virtual Machine, you can try the following:
Reboot your system into
BIOS/UEFI settings
(you may Google your specific laptop brand on how to do so).
Once you are in the BIOS/UEFI settings, look for keywords relating to virtualization:
Intel VT-x
,
AMD-V
,
SVM
,
Intel Virtualization Technology
or similar.
Toggle
the virtualization settings (on to off, off to on).
Save and exit the BIOS/UEFI.
Try to access the exam/quiz via Lockdown Browser again.
When installing, I received "InstallShield setup launched but seems to have closed without finishing" message.
760
This issue will be accompanied with the issue of accessing the user Temporary Folder via the %temp% environment variable. To fix this issue, perform the following:
Open Windows Explorer, then
navigate
to
C:\Users
.
Look for a
file that have no extension
that is named your first part of your username (e.g., if your username is John Smith, there should be a file called "John" there).
Remove
the file from the Users folder.
Try to run the installer again.
My exam or quiz loads properly, but I am unable to type anything in textbox.
760
This happens due to a third-party keyboard interfering with the Lockdown Browser. You may try to
change your input method to English (US)
before launching and see if that solves the issue. In the worst-case scenario, you will need to uninstall the third-party keyboard software to fix the issue.
As of today, the software that is known to cause issue is the Burmese (Myanmar3) keyboard from Keyman. You may
uninstall
Keyman
from your system temporarily for your test or exam to avoid this issue.
Mac OS
Lockdown Browser keeps updating
760
When Lockdown Browser for Mac goes into a constant "update loop" when starting the browser, we recommend the following steps:
Directly log into your Mac as a user with "Allow user to administer this computer" in System Preferences-Users & Groups.
Download a fresh copy of Lockdown Browser from your school's unique download link:

Re-install the browser.
If the deadline for an exam is near, you may want to consider locating another computer, Mac or Windows, with LockDown Browser. There is also LockDown Browser for iPad, if allowed by the instructor.
The Installation Failed when updating Lockdown Browser
760

How do I mitigate any system updates during the exam?
760
By verifying and updating the below components beforehand, you can mitigate the risk of any unforeseen updates or technical issues that may arise during the exam. Taking these steps will help ensure a stable and reliable exam environment, allowing you to focus on your assessments without interruptions.
Laptop System Updates: Please check for and install any pending system updates for your laptop. Keeping your operating system up to date will help prevent unexpected interruptions or restarts during the exam.
Windows Updates: Verify that your Windows operating system is updated to the latest version. Regular Windows updates provide important security patches and improvements that can enhance the performance of your system during the exam.
Safe Exam Browser Update: SEB may not actively prompt you about an update, thus minimising interruptions during exams. However, it is important to check their website for potentially important updates. You may refer to their download page here:

Will Safe Exam Browser interfere with my computer settings?
760
Generally, Safe Exam Browser will install and run with no issues on a standard laptop with factory settings. In the event your device is modified with certain performance enhancing, remote access or screen recording apps, or you have modified settings on your device, there may be issues. For first time users, please ensure you attend the MOCK exam conducted by your lecturer so that any such issues can be identified and rectified.
What happens if the Internet connection is poor, and I lose connectivity?
760
APU has subscribed to and installed a dedicated SSID for the exam halls and we do not anticipate any downtime. However, you can do your part by ensuring that your device is not running any additional applications that use Wi-Fi. By default, open applications will be turned off by Safe Exam Browser once it starts running.
What am I allowed to bring into the exam hall?
760
You are allowed to bring ONLY your laptop and charger into the exam hall. All other paraphernalia, if necessary, will be provided by the Exam Unit. If your exam requires the use of a calculator, your lecturer will enable the laptop calculator to be used with Safe Exam Browser. Formula booklet (if required for your exam) will be provided by the exam unit as well.
What do I do if my laptop runs out of battery?
760
APU has installed over 100 power supply points at each desk in the exam hall. You can plug in to the point right below your desk for supply for your device. Please ensure you have your device charger with you at all times when you have exams.
For Math and Engineering exams, do we need to answer in the Moodle platform?
760
The exam questions will be provided via the Moodle link which would have been setup by your lecturer, however the exam answers have to be written in the answer booklet, provided by the exam unit. The answer booklet will later be collected from you.
When can I check my exam timetable?
760
You may check one month before your exam week starts.
Where can I check my exam timetable?
760
You may check in APSpace by clicking below link and search by your intake code:
https://apspace.apu.edu.my/exam-schedule (https://apspace.apu.edu.my/exam-schedule)
What if I forget to bring/lost my student’s ID card?

760
You must submit an Extenuating Circumstances (EC) application:
https://apiit.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/6/article/221152223?src=98897554 (https://apiit.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/6/article/221152223?src=98897554)
If I have an outstanding fee, can I sit for the exam?
760
No. You are not allowed to sit for the exam as your Moodle account is being blocked.
Who should I contact regarding my outstanding fees?
760
Please email to APU Bursary Team (

760
You can leave the exam hall 30 minutes after the start of the exam, or 15 minutes before the end of the exam.
Can I go to the washroom during the exam?
760
You are discouraged from using the washroom during the examination.  If you need to go to the washroom. Take note of your table number and register your exit to the washroom at the book located at the front desk.
Troubleshooting
It is important that you attend mock exams held by your lecturers, so that you may discover and iron out any potential issue that may arise from your device when running SEB. Doing so will save you a lot of trouble than having to deal with it during exam day.
Kindly ensure that you have done the following before the start of your exam:
Safe Exam Browser (
SafeExamBrowser.exe
) is whitelisted by your antivirus software
Disable or uninstall any virtual machine that you have installed
Disable or uninstall custom mouse cursors
I received an error about multiple screens when launching Safe Exam Browser. What should I do?
760
Ensure that your display settings is set to 1, as Safe Exam Browser only allows 1 active display. You may refer to the following image on which settings to change:
I received the error message: "SEB failed to start a new session! Please consult the log files for more information."
760
This is likely caused by the following reasons:
Antivirus software preventing SEB from launching
Virtual machine process running in the background (does not have to be launched)
Custom mouse cursors
To resolve these issues, you may do the following:
Whitelist Safe Exam Browser in your Antivirus. Methods may vary from brand to brand, but generally, you will need to whitelist the executable (
SafeExamBrowser.exe
). If you are still facing those errors even after whitelisting Safe Exam Browser, you may need to temporarily disable your antivirus software, usually something akin to real-time protection (naming may vary depending on the software you are using)
End those processes before you start the exam
If you are unable to end those processes or whitelist SEB, you may need to delete them. It is highly recommended that you backup your programs before that
I received an error message stating: "Application not found" when SEB is launching. What should I do?
760
This is likely happening because Safe Exam Browser is trying to close a program that may have already been closed, usually you will see it as being “Teams.exe” or “Ms-Teams.exe”. Just click OK and continue as usual.
I received an error stating: "An unexpected error while trying to load configuration resources". What should I do?
760
This happens when a student tries to launch the exam via a downloaded config file instead of launching via the exam in Moodle. This has been covered in the
KnowledgeBase article (https://apiit.atlassian.net/wiki/x/FIDkQg)
, stating that students MUST launch their exam from Moodle.
I got a blank screen when attemting to access the exam.
760
This is due to the customized Moodle theme settings. To change back your Moodle theme to Default, perform the following:
Login to Moodle:
https://lms2.apiit.edu.my/my/ (https://lms2.apiit.edu.my/my/)
Click on the profile at the top right and click
Preferences
.
Under User account, click
Edit profile
.
Under General, look for Preferred theme, then change it to
Default
.
Scroll down and click
Update profile
.
Launch the exam/quiz again.
I constantly receive a pop-up message saying: "Installing kiosk mode", or is constantly flashing while "Installing Kiosk Mode" is loading. What should I do?
760
According to SEB's github page, it mentioned that it is likely caused by third party applications (link:
https://github.com/SafeExamBrowser/seb-win-refactoring/issues/871). (https://github.com/SafeExamBrowser/seb-win-refactoring/issues/871).)
). Gaming hubs may be one of the reasons i.e. OMEN Gaming Hub as a provided example, or it could also be caused by anti-malware programs, or some other third-party programmes. You will need to end their processes, or delete them if they refuse to end properly.
What should I do when facing a System Integrity Protection warning when attempting to launch SEB (for MacOS)?
760
If you receive a warning that you need to enable System Integrity Protection in order to launch SEB, you need to do the following:
Restart your computer in
Recovery mode (https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201314)
.
Launch Terminal from the Utilities menu.
Run the command
csrutil enable
.
Restart your computer.
How do I resolve the runtime error?
760
Run
SafeExamBrowser.ResetUtility.exe
(can be found in this pathway by default
C:\Program Files\SafeExamBrowser\Reset
)
Select “
Reset system configuration to default values
” when selecting an option
After running the reset utility, force restart the device as a restart would likely be needed to have the reset take effect (hold down power button for at least 10 seconds for a complete restart)
After the device has restarted, disable all anti-virus software before starting the exam
It is highly recommended that you restart your laptop after your exam so as to clear the previous exam’s session. This should help mitigate the runtime error issue for future exams.

Step 4:
On the right side of the button where the drop-down menu is, you can choose the option export marks via Excel.
Step 5:
If you have exported the assignment marks, you can untick everything else and select only the Quiz activity:
Step 6:
Once you have selected what you want to export, click the Download button located at the bottom right side of the page.
Step 7:
You can highlight all marks, copy, and then paste them in OBE’s grade column.
Step 7.a:
In OBE, you may click on ‘TP Number’ to sort the students according to their TP Number.

URL: https://apiit.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ITSM/pages/2862481436/Missing+Moodle+folder+and+or+Attendance+for+new+intakes

If you have an upcoming intake and you notice that the intake specific folders and/or attendances are not available for them, most of the time, it is because the programme admin has not yet create the class setup.
Important details to note before you open a helpdesk ticket:
A script generates Moodle folders automatically, but it will
require
that the programme admin has already create the class setup first. Without the class setup, no new intake specific folders will generate.
The same thing applies to attendance. Without the class setup, attendance for that class will not be created.
If you do not see
both
attendance and Moodle folder for the upcoming class that you are about to teach, it is very likely that the programme admin has not yet create the class setup. Should you have any further queries, please refer to them accordingly.
However, if you notice that the attendance is already available but not the Moodle folder, you can email helpdesk to have the matter investigated.
Note:
Do be noted that Moodle folders are
not generated instantly
, they will usually take 1 to 2 hours to show up after the class setup has been created. Larger classes may potentially take slightly longer time to generate, but it should not cross over to the next day. In the event it does, you can email helpdesk to have the matter investigated.
