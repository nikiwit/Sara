In order to avoid “Invalid Status”, it is very important to not tailgate the vehicle that is trying to enter or exit the premise. Do ensure that the barricade is fully lowered before attempting to enter/exit and ensure that the card reader shows a valid message before proceeding.

The charges incurred are for the number of days the vehicle has been parked in the parking area. Thus, the balance you have will not cover for the extra days involved due to insufficient balance.

It means either the APCard is not active or there was an improper exit done by the driver before. An improper exit refers to exiting by tailgating too closely to the car in front, and as a result, failing to register the entry/exit on the reader.
What should I do?
Please visit APU cashier counter and report your issue.

--- PAGE: Prepaid Smart Meter ---
URL: https://apiit.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/LNO/pages/2383872728/Prepaid+Smart+Meter

In our commitment to sustainability and reducing our carbon footprint, the adoption of Smart Meters aligns perfectly with our University's "green" initiatives. These smart meters offer real-time monitoring of their consumption, enabling us to collectively make more informed choices about our energy usage. By being more conscious of their own consumption patterns, students could potentially contribute to conserving energy making a positive impact on the environment.
The Prepaid Smart Meter system gives students' greater control over their energy consumption.
Real-time data access allows students to monitor their usage and learn how to conserve energy effectively.
The system promotes fairness by charging units only for consumed energy.
It encourages collective responsibility for energy use among residents in shared living spaces.
