 FAQ
Why cluster code has been added to the class code?
Because the same module being taught at the exact start date can carry the same lecture, tutorial, or lab class number. As so, the cluster is at the beginning of the code to ensure there are no duplicate codes created in GIMS. 
Why haven't we added the intakes to the class code? 
As an example below case two intakes are merging to study the above class for example APU2102SE, APU2102CT as result the class code had to be changed in APP___CT042-3-1-IDB-LAB-1___2020-06-14___CT-SE the drawbacks are: 
1. Merging intakes / separating intakes until week 3 or 4: 
As we are aware the numbers of the students may change in a class and therefore the classes may need separating or merging meaning the above class code may need to change on week 3 or 4 to; 
APP___CT042-3-1-IDB-LAB-1___2020-06-14___CT 
APP___CT042-3-1-IDB-LAB-1___2020-06-14___SE 
But sometimes the class codes are used across different systems  and the first requirements of the class codes are to be unique (Moodle, APSpace, Appendix, Feedback and etc) it had to have some level of stability  
2. The class codes needed to be short: 
Some modules are general like MPU or IMT modules which are offered across the schools. These modules may have lecturers with around 30 to 40 intakes in a class the length of the class code would be out of hand. See example below

--- PAGE: What happens when IT equipment fails? ---
The following examples typically represent some of the most frequently encountered situations with appropriate guidance given.   
 Circumstances and guidelines involving IT equipment failure which prevented you from acquiring
skills/knowledge/competencies:
 Failure of your personal computer or laptop
 If you encounter problems with your personal laptop or desktop equipment during the time of assessment submission, then evidence of having the equipment repaired/enhanced at a service/repair outlet, during the assessment period, must be provided. Failure to provide any evidence, would result in the claim being rejected.
Failure of network connection
If you encounter network connectivity issues which affects your work during the assessment submission whether its examination or assignment submission, then evidence of the network issue with appropriate time stamp and screen shots must be provided along with any related engagement with the concerned lecturer or invigilation staff, without which the claim will be rejected. 
Failure to provide appropriate software
 If you choose to do an individual project based on a particular version/type of software, then the onus is upon you to ensure that this software is available prior to starting the project. This action should form part of your project plan, and any problems arising from compatibility or availability of appropriate software would not be accepted as valid extenuating circumstances on the basis that it would show an      inappropriate lack of planning.
Insufficient computers in the lab for the class size
 It would be expected that the lecturer concerned would take appropriate action in such an eventuality and if necessary take this issue into account as part of the assessment of the module.
 
Failure affecting a large number of systems at assignment deadline time
 
If a significant number of computers were out of action for several hours then this might form the basis for  granting a short extension to the assignment deadline.
 You should request the Technical Assistant to countersign your claim for extenuating circumstances.
Theft of home computer or laptop
Students are expected to make a backup copy of all their work on an appropriate backup device. This should be stored separately from the computer/laptop. A claim submitted on this basis would not be upheld.
Insufficient computers/printers to do the work
 A claim submitted upon this basis would not be supported on the grounds that it would indicate lack of  advanced planning by you.
APU/APIIT’s systems incompatible with home computer/laptop
 It would be expected that you should check that work brought in from home could be presented or printed at APU/APIIT well before an assessment deadline. A claim submitted on this basis would not be upheld.
Failure of the computer resulting in an inability to save work
 A claim submitted on this basis should always be accompanied by the submission of the latest draft of  your work.
 The computer labs closed earlier than expected
 A claim submitted upon this basis would not be supported on the grounds that it would indicate a lack of advanced planning by you.
Failure of a Backup Device
This is one of the most common claims for extenuating circumstances and is rarely upheld. If you are expected to be computer literate, you should have a secure back up copy of your work and therefore should not be affected seriously by the loss of work from your backup device.
If your backup device does fail, you must submit the latest draft of your work by the normal hand-in date for that piece of work. It would certainly not be acceptable for a final year student to submit a claim on this basis.
Failure of both main disk and back up device
There may be occasions when a faulty system may have caused the corruption of all of your storage device. It may be possible for APU/APIIT Technical Services staff to confirm that this had occurred and it is expected that you would be able to submit the latest draft of your work.

--- PAGE: Who will consider my claim? ---
The Office of Extenuating Circumstances Claims will liaise with School(s) responsible for the programme to which the claim relates. The claim submitted is reviewed individually and confidentially.
 The Office decides whether to uphold your claim or not and will inform you via the online system, of its decision.

--- PAGE: Supporting Evidence ---
Please note that minor illnesses or ailments will 
not normally 
be accepted as valid reasons for extenuating  circumstances. Unless you have seen a Doctor or Counsellor 
at the time 
of your illness or problem, it is unlikely that your claim will be accepted. For instance, a letter from a Specialist Medical Centre or Government Hospital   stating that you were seen on a particular date and told him/her that you 
HAD BEEN 
ill will not normally be accepted.
Dates of evidence must correspond with the extenuating circumstances detailed.
Where documentary evidence is not available then a supporting statement is required in support of your claim. This should be obtained from a Medical Doctor at a public hospital or specialist clinic, Programme Leader, Academic Mentor, Module Lecturer/Tutor, Welfare Counsellor or other independent suitably qualified person.
 A medical report must be on headed paper and/or stamped by the clinic/hospital.
Your circumstances will dictate the nature of the evidence that is required to be submitted. For example, an illness would require evidence from a Specialist Medical Centre or Government Hospital, or Welfare Counsellor. Academic Mentor or Programme Leader will be able to offer advice to you on the appropriate form   of evidence which will be required for other kinds of circumstance, particularly if it is not practically possible to produce evidence at the time (e.g. close family bereavement, assault etc). In the case of a close family bereavement, a death certificate or a letter from an appropriate relative or Medical Doctor or other corroborating evidence will be accepted.

--- PAGE: What if I have no evidence? ---
A claim is unlikely to be upheld without appropriate supporting evidence. You should review the circumstances   and try to find an independent person, organization or support service that can provide verification. A member of staff may be able to provide a supporting statement.

--- PAGE: If I submit a claim for extenuating circumstances when do I have to hand in my work? ---
Where a claim for extenuating circumstances on assessment has been submitted, you must continue to complete the assessment work (e.g. incourse with a predetermined deadline, Investigation Report, Final Year Project report) and submit it as soon as it is completed while waiting for the decision of the extenuating circumstances claim.
The Office of Extenuating Circumstances Claims will take account of the timing of your extenuating circumstances and the original submission date. The final decision of the new submission date will be made by the Office if the claim is upheld.

--- PAGE: What should I include when I explain my circumstances? ---
The circumstances must have been at the same time as the acquisition of the skill/knowledge/competency or the assessment of the module. If you have missed an assignment through ill health, then the illness must coincide   with the preparation, writing or deadline of that assessment.
If you are a part-time student and have been unable to submit your work by the original deadline date because, for instance, you were required by your employer to work away from home for several weeks at the time you should have submitted your work, you must provide a letter from your employer confirming this. The circumstances should be detailed concisely. The Extenuating Circumstances Claims Office should be provided with the essential information to enable it to make an informed decision regarding the circumstances.

--- PAGE: What happens next if my claim is upheld? ---
If your claim is upheld for extenuating circumstances in late submission of assessment(s), then your work will be marked and a grade confirmed by the appropriate Board in due course.
If your claim is upheld for extenuating circumstances in attendance, your attendance record will be updated accordingly.
Please note that you will not simply be given a higher grade because of your extenuating circumstances.

--- PAGE: What grounds will not normally be considered as extenuating circumstances? ---
You may not normally claim extenuating circumstances on the basis that your academic performance has been affected by family, financial or other lifestyle problems. In particular, extenuating circumstances cannot normally be claimed on any of the following grounds (the list is not exhaustive):
 Normally, the second or subsequent attempt of an element of assessment (exam or coursework) where an EC has   been upheld for a previous attempt
Inadequate planning, organisation or management on your part, this may include:
Development of a solution taking longer than anticipated
Learning a programming language taking longer than anticipated
Technical difficulties in integrating elements of a solution, etc
Timetabling of coursework or examinations
Misreading of assessment dates and times
Personal computer or printer problems
Minor illnesses, such as a cold
Holidays or social occasions
Transport problems
Moving house
Normal work patterns and pressures of employment
Pregnancy (unless unexpected complications occur)
If you are uncertain whether your claim might be legitimate, please discuss this with your Academic Mentor or  your Programme Leader.
Any student who is alleged to have submitted falsified evidence in support of a claim of extenuating circumstances will be referred for consideration under the terms of the APU/APIIT Academic Dishonesty Regulations.

--- PAGE: What else do I need to do? ---
It is your responsibility to supply the appropriate evidence to support your claim.
Supporting documents/evidences that are in a language other than English or Bahasa Melayu must be accompanied by a certified translation of the original documents.
Where your EC concerns sickness, a medical certificate/full medical report from a registered medical practitioner from clinic or  Government Hospital will be required.
You should not submit a claim where a single seminar, lecture or lab work has been missed due to  illness.
If you join an award part-way through the semester, late entry will not be viewed as an extenuating circumstance. This would not be considered to be an appropriate basis upon which to submit a claim   for extenuating circumstances.

--- PAGE: What happens if my claim is not upheld? ---
Should you wish to appeal against a decision reached by the Office of Extenuating Circumstances Claims then you   must do so in writing within 
7 working days
 of receipt of the decision using the normal appeals procedure.
It should be noted that the only grounds for an appeal against the decision of an Extenuating Circumstances Claim are that
The Office did not take full and proper account of your extenuating circumstances claim; 
OR
New, relevant and independent evidence, which for good reason you had been unable to make   available to the Office of Extenuating Circumstances Claims, had become available.

--- PAGE: Vice Chancellor's List for Academic Excellence ---


--- PAGE: Communication to Students ---


--- PAGE: Year 2023 ---


--- PAGE: How do I qualify for the VC’s List? ---
The VC’s List is based on a student’s Grade Point Average (GPA) for the year.
This is an honour roll for students who have achieved an average grade point of 3.70 or higher in modules taken for that academic year.
Students enrolled in Degree programmes.
To be listed, a student must have passed all modules, including MPU and Internship/Industrial Placement modules.
A student who has been found guilty of misconduct will not be eligible to be included on the VC’s List for Academic Excellence in the same academic year that the misconduct occurred.
A student may be listed as a member of VC’s List more than once for the duration of the programme if they continue to achieve excellent academic results and meet the criteria.

--- PAGE: Do I need to apply for VC’s List? ---
No, you need not apply to be on the VC’s List. Students are placed on the VC’s List if they satisfy the above criteria.

--- PAGE: What is the benefit as a member of the VC’s List? ---
Recipients of the VC’s List will be given a certificate recognizing the achievement.

--- PAGE: Where can I collect the VC’s list certificate? ---
The VC’s List certificate is available from the Administration Office during operating hours. Details of the collection venue will be provided in the email notification.

--- PAGE: Am I eligible if there is pending grade for modules? ---
Students are strongly encouraged to clear the pending grades at the earliest opportunity. Late grades may affect eligibility for inclusion on the VC’s List.
For example, you have a pending grade due to extenuating circumstances in Year 2 Semester 2, you must clear it as soon as possible by the end of teaching weeks in Year 3 Semester 1 in order to be qualified for inclusion in the supplementary VC’s List.

--- PAGE: How frequent will the VC’s List be announced? ---
The VC’s List will be announced on a yearly basis for students who qualify.
Depending on the number of intakes, this list will be generated 3 to 4 times per academic year.

--- PAGE: What is Vice Chancellor’s (VC’s) List for academic excellence? ---
A VC’s List is compiled at the end of each academic year. Typically, this is an honour roll for students who have achieved an average grade point of 3.70 or higher for that academic year. In the case of APU, given the multi-intake scenario, this honour list will be compiled 3 or 4 times a year.

--- PAGE: Can I appeal for the inclusion in VC’s List? ---
The VC’s List is based purely on academic merit.  Decision of the VC’s List is final and not subject to appeal.

--- PAGE: I have completed my study and want to request a letter from the University to confirm my study completion while waiting for certificate issuance ---

Policy for Failure/ Non-attendance/Non-submission of referral assessment 
Referral Assessment 
Non-attendance of exam or failure to submit required coursework
As stated in the resit guidelines, it is compulsory to attend the scheduled resit exams. Non-attendance or failure to submit required coursework for a resit will result in a failing grade. If you are required to resit any module(s), this will be indicated on your APSpace web result page.
Extenuating Circumstances (EC):
If you miss a resit exam or fail to submit coursework due to extenuating circumstances (EC), you must submit an EC application through the EC Submission which is available at E-Forms, along with supporting documents. Your application will be reviewed by the EC panel. If your EC application is approved, you will still be required to pay the resit fee of RM 150, as indicated in your APSpace (
please refer to knowledge base on the EC guidelines
: 
click here
).  If your absence or non-submission was not due to a valid EC, and you wish to appeal for consideration, you must submit an appeal to the University Appeals Committee (UAC).
Appeals Process:
If you have a non-attendance (no-show) or fail to submit the required coursework for a resit without a valid EC or if your EC application is rejected, you may submit an appeal through the academic appeal system. An appeal fee of RM 50.00 will be charged on top of the first referral fee and any subsequent resit fees. Please note that a second resit opportunity after a 
no-show
 is not automatically granted; it will only be considered if your appeal is approved by the University Appeals Committee (UAC).
