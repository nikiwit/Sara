There are two different formats of in-text citation, parenthetical and narrative. Both formats require two elements:
Author's name
Year of publication
Parenthetical citations are the more commonly seen form of in-text citations for academic work. Both required reference elements are presented at the end of the sentence in parentheses.
E.g. (Belafonte, 2008).
In narrative citations, the author's name will be separated from the date. The date must appear immediately after the author's name but in parenthesis.
E.g. Belafonte (2008).

Below are the steps to write the APA reference list :
Begin the reference list on a new page after the text.
Place the section label "References" in bold at the top of the page, centered.
Double-space the reference list, both within and between references. Do not add extra lines between references.
Order references alphabetically, usually by the first letter of the first author's last name.
Include the authors' first and middle initials (if they have them). Do not write out first or middle names.
Write author names in the inverted format so that the last name comes first, followed by a comma and the initials. Place a period and a space after each initial.
Apply a hanging indent for all references using the paragraph-formatting function of your word processing program: The first line is flush left, and all subsequent lines are indented 0.5 inches.
