## 12. Information Currency Testing

### Question 12.1: How do I install SQL Server for my course?

**SARA's Response:**
```
To install SQL Server for your course, you can follow the installation guideline provided in the IT Guides and Information section of APU's ITSM Knowledge Base. Here are the steps:

### Installation Guideline for Microsoft SQL Server Developer + SSMS Windows 11

1. **Download SQL Server Installer**: Visit the official Microsoft website to download the SQL Server installer. Ensure you select the appropriate version based on your system requirements.

2. **Run the Installer**: After downloading, run the SQL Server installation program. You will be prompted with a series of screens where you can configure the installation settings such as installation location and features.

3. **Select Features**: Choose the features that are relevant to your needs. For example, if you need SSMS (SQL Server Management Studio), make sure to select it during the feature selection process.

4. **Configure Installation Location**: Specify the directory where SQL Server will be installed. Make sure this location is accessible and has sufficient disk space for the installation files and databases.

5. **Complete the Installation**: Follow through with the remaining steps of the installer, including accepting the license terms and completing any additional configurations required by your setup.

6. **Start SQL Server Services**: After the installation completes successfully, start the SQL Server services to ensure they are running properly.

For more detailed instructions or specific versions (e.g., for Mac), you can refer to the following link:

### Question 12.2: What are the parking invalid status causes?

**SARA's Response:**
```
The causes of an invalid status in the parking system can be due to several reasons:

1. **Improper Entry/Exit**: This occurs when exiting by tailgating too closely to the car in front, resulting in failing to register the entry/exit on the reader.
2. **Inactive APCard**: Your card might not be activated or there could be an issue with its status.
3. **Incomplete Entry-Exit Cycle**: If you have not completed your entry-exit cycle properly, it can lead to an invalid status.

To avoid getting "Invalid Status," ensure that:
- The barricade is fully lowered before attempting to enter/exit the parking area.
- Your card reader shows a valid message before proceeding.
- You do not tailgate too closely when exiting the parking area.
```
